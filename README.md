# Merge Excel files in Python

Hello, welcome to my first Python script. This script will work for you to combine all the information from your Excel files into a single sheet, as long as those files have the same format.

If you are just starting to use Python, you'll need to install the Pandas extension. In case another extension is underlined in yellow, you should install the other extensions.

To install the extension, you must run the following command in the terminal of your code editor:

`pip install pandas`

In case your computer doesn't have permissions enabled and you get an error when installing, you should do the following:

1. Search in Windows for the option _Edit System Environment Variables_.
2. Open the _Environment Variables_ option, select the _Path_ option and click on the edit button.
3. Find the user folder on the local disk and select the _AppData_ folder. Inside _AppData_ look for the _Local_ folder and then _Programs_, select the _Python_ folder and copy the path.
4. Inside the option of _Environment Variables_ you give it new and paste the route.

If when you go into the User folder in the local disk, the _AppData_ folder doesn't appear, don't worry, you only must enable the option to see hidden folders.
